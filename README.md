# logisim_evo
A collection of [Logisim Evolution](https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution) circuits.

Logisim Evolution is an excellent, open source graphical logic simulator.

This repo includes an [Ultimate RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_instruction_set_computer), or One Instruction Set Computer. More specifically, this is a [Transport Triggered Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_triggered_architecture) (TTA) that only supports the MOVE instruction. The design was influenced by the [Maxim MAXQ](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/3222) processor.

In addition, a simple traffic light controller is implemented as a [Moore state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_machine).
